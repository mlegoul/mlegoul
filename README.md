## What I'm Looking For

My passion lies in being part of **open-minded communities** where the focus extends beyond mere tools to encompass the concepts, philosophies, and ideas that drive technological innovation. I find joy in engaging with both **front-end and back-end development**, constantly seeking new challenges and avenues to champion the values and practices I hold dear.

While certain technologies like **JavaScript** have a special place in my toolkit, my primary interest revolves around the pursuit of **software quality** and the **culture of Craftsmanship**. I am always eager to expand my horizons, exploring new languages and methodologies that push the boundaries of what we can achieve in software development.

My goal is to join forces with individuals and teams who are not just looking to solve problems, but to redefine the way we think about solutions in the digital age.
