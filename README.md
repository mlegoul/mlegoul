# 👋 Hi, I’m Mehdi

## Summary

🌱 I've been working for 3 years in JavaScript in web companies and tech companies in France

💞️ I’m looking to start collaborating in open-source (TypeScript/Rust or else)

📫 The best is to reach me here 😉

## Experiences

- **Software Developer** 🛩 : Started a new job in WeVii since september 2022
- **Frontend Developer** 🏥 : in the eHealth sector
- **Developer** 🖥 : in a web agency

## What I want

I'm mainly looking to join open-minded communities, good places and people to work with. I enjoy working on the front-end as much as the back-end. I attend trade shows to meet people and advocate for the things I believe in.

I prefer to work with concepts and people rather than tools or languages, but I still have preferences, like JavaScript. I'm also interested in software quality and Craftsmanship culture, as well as the Rust language.
